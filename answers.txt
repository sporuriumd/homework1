What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
  Merging keeps the whole history of your repository while rebasing creates a linear history by moving your feature branch onto the tip of main. (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing#:~:text=Merging%20is%20a%20safe%20option,onto%20the%20tip%20of%20main%20.)
What is a remote repository?
  A remote repository is a version of your project that is hosted on a server that can be acccessed by others.
